Frink respects your privacy. This document explains how we handle any data collected while you use the bot.

### What Data We Collect

### How We Use Your Data

- To manage the `!marry` feature, we store the user IDs of both participants.
- All other data is used transiently to respond to commands.
- We **do not sell, share, or distribute** any data.

### Data Retention

- Marriage data is stored only as long as the relationship exists.
- Users can remove their marriage data by using the `!divorce` command.
- No other data is stored persistently.

### Your Rights

- If you have a marriage recorded in the bot, you can delete it with `!divorce` or contact us.
- Other data is not stored, so there is nothing else to delete or export.
